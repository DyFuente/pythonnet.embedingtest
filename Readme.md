# PythonNetTester

This is a suit of tests that verify pythonnet package works according
to my expectations.  

`TestLoadScript.cs` contains VisualStudio Unit tests for each of the 
features I want to test.

`scripts` holds the python scripts that get executed

`Multiplier.cs` implements a .net class which gets called by python to test
calls back to .net code.
